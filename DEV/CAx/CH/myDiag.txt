DIAGNOSIS:

THYROID, LEFT, EXCISION FOR FLOW CYTOMETRY:
- NO IDENTIFIABLE B CELLS;
- SEE COMMENT.

Comment: Viability: 100%. The cells were analyzed for forward and side
scatter and for immunophenotype using antibodies to CD2, CD11b, CD45,
CD20, surface kappa light chains, surface lambda light chains, CD19,
FMC-7, CD23, CD5, CD103, CD11c, CD25, HLA-DR, CD38, CD10, and CD49d.

Analysis of the dot plots of forward versus side scatter and CD45 versus
side scatter disclosed a large amount of debris and a few possible
lymphocytes. Analysis of the lymphocytes showed a few T cells but no B
cells.

The analysis contained too few B lymphocytes for evaluation. See also
surgical pathology case (S14-17669).

DIAGNOSIS:

LEFT THYROID MASS, INCISIONAL BIOPSY:
- DIFFUSE LARGE B CELL LYMPHOMA, WITH HIGH-GRADE FEATURES
- SEE COMMENT

Comment: Sections demonstrate sheets of intermediate-sized to
large-sized atypical lymphocytes with vesicular chromatin, nuclear
membrane irregularities, and variably prominent nucleoli. The areas
with intermediate-sized nuclei are somewhat necrotic in appearance, with
increased amounts of apoptotic cells and small, shrunken,
necrotic-appearing lymphocytes. The sheets of large atypical
lymphocytes are present in a background of chronic lymphocytic
thyroiditis with features of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. There are also
associated foci of chronic inflammation with increased reactive T-cells
and residual CD23-positive follicular dendritic cell meshworks. The
large atypical lymphoid cells are diffusely positive for CD20 and BCL-6.
CD10 is positive but with weak intensity. BCL-2 is negative. CD23 is
focally positive within the large atypical lymphoid cells. Cytokeratin
AE1/AE3 highlights residual follicular epithelium but is negative within
the malignant cell population. The Ki-67/MIB-1 proliferation rate is
markedly elevated (greater than 80%, and possibly greater than 90%).
CD3 and CD5 stain interspersed T-cells. The corresponding flow
cytometric evaluation (S14-17867) is non-contributory due to lack of
viable lymphoid cells (presumably due to necrosis).

The histologic and immunophenotypic findings are indicative of diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma, probably arising in the context of a chronic
lymphocytic thyroiditis. In addition, the lymphoma has high-grade
features (markedly elevated Ki67 proliferation rate and lack of BCL-2
expression). Therefore, if clinically indicated, additional testing for
C-MYC, BCL-2, and BCL-6 gene rearrangements by FISH analysis can be
performed as reference laboratory send-out tests, upon request.

Case shown in consultation to Dr. Fricke, and findings discussed with
Dr. Saleh on May 7, 2014.
